# Research Phase Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure thorough research before moving to design.

## Codebase Exploration
- [ ] Identified all files that will need modification
- [ ] Traced data flow for affected features
- [ ] Found existing patterns to follow
- [ ] Located similar implementations as reference
- [ ] Mapped integration points with other systems

## Assumption Verification
- [ ] Listed all assumptions from understand phase
- [ ] Found evidence for each assumption (file:line)
- [ ] Updated understanding for any refuted assumptions
- [ ] Documented surprises or unexpected findings

## Technical Research
- [ ] Researched relevant libraries/frameworks
- [ ] Checked API capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Identified performance constraints
- [ ] Noted rate limits, pagination, or caching needs

## Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Documented coding conventions used
- [ ] Found error handling patterns
- [ ] Identified testing approaches
- [ ] Noted naming conventions

## Dependency Mapping
- [ ] Listed all systems this feature touches
- [ ] Identified upstream dependencies
- [ ] Found downstream effects
- [ ] Noted any external service dependencies

## Documentation
- [ ] Created research-notes.md in story directory
- [ ] Included file:line references for all findings
- [ ] Listed recommendations for design phase
- [ ] Flagged any remaining open questions

## Quality Check
- [ ] Research is comprehensive, not just surface-level
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly verified, not assumed correct
- [ ] Findings are specific with concrete references
- [ ] No blocking questions remain
